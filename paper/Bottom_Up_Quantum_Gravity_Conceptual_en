Abstract 
We present a minimal bottom-up framework in which space, time and gravity emerge from 
the entanglement structure of a global quantum state, without assuming any background 
spacetime or predefined geometry. Using finite-size quantum systems, we demonstrate that 
geometric and gravitational notions can be reconstructed operationally from quantum 
correlations alone. 
Our approach relies on three central ingredients. First, a relational notion of time is defined 
via the modular flow associated with reduced density matrices. Second, an emergent spatial 
geometry is reconstructed from mutual information by defining an information-theoretic 
distance and embedding it using multidimensional scaling (MDS). Third, a thermodynamic 
interpretation of gravity is tested through a Jacobson-type relation linking variations of 
entanglement entropy and energy. 
We establish these results on a minimal system of N=9 qubits, serving as a fully tractable 
proof of concept, and then extend the analysis to N=16 qubits to reduce finite-size and 
boundary effects. The extension confirms the robustness of three key signatures: emergent 
dimensionality, ER=EPR–like geodesic shortening, and a stable thermodynamic relation. 
These results provide a numerical proof of principle that spacetime geometry and effective 
gravity may arise from quantum entanglement alone. 
1. Introduction 
One of the central open questions of modern theoretical physics concerns the origin of 
spacetime itself. While quantum field theory successfully describes matter and interactions on 
a fixed background, and general relativity describes the dynamics of spacetime geometry, 
neither framework explains why spacetime exists or why gravity exhibits a deep 
thermodynamic structure. 
This work explores a radical but minimal hypothesis: spacetime is not fundamental, but 
emergent. Rather than quantizing gravity, we ask whether geometric and gravitational notions 
can be reconstructed directly from the internal structure of a global quantum state. In this 
view, spacetime is not the stage on which physics unfolds, but a collective, effective 
description of quantum correlations. 
Our approach is explicitly bottom-up. We start from a finite quantum system with no 
background geometry, no external time, and no classical fields. All notions of distance, 
dimension, time, and gravity must be inferred operationally from the quantum state itself. The 
goal is not to derive full general relativity, but to demonstrate, through explicit numerical 
constructions, that its key conceptual ingredients can emerge from entanglement. 
2. Minimal Postulate 
The framework rests on a single postulate: 
There exists a pure global quantum state |Ψ⟩ defined on a finite set of elementary degrees of 
freedom (qubits), with no predefined spacetime, metric, or causal structure. 
No background geometry is assumed. There is no external time parameter and no classical 
notion of distance. The state |Ψ⟩ is atemporal in the sense that it does not evolve with respect 
to any external clock. Any notion of dynamics must therefore arise from internal correlations 
between subsystems. 
This minimal postulate deliberately removes all classical structures and forces space, time, 
and gravity to emerge, if at all, from the quantum state alone. 
3. Emergent Time from Modular Flow 
In the absence of an external time parameter, a relational notion of time can be defined by 
partitioning the global Hilbert space into a subsystem playing the role of a clock and the rest 
of the system. This idea follows the Page–Wootters mechanism, in which time is identified 
with correlations between subsystems rather than an external parameter. 
For any chosen region A, we define the reduced density matrix ρ_A by tracing out the 
complement of A. The associated modular Hamiltonian is defined as K_A = −log(ρ_A). The 
modular flow generated by K_A defines an intrinsic evolution of observables within the 
subsystem. 
In this framework, time is not fundamental but emergent: it is an internal parameter associated 
with the structure of entanglement. The modular flow provides a concrete and operational 
definition of time directly derived from the quantum state |Ψ⟩. 
4. Emergent Space from Mutual Information 
To reconstruct a notion of space, we quantify correlations between subsystems using quantum 
mutual information. For any pair of sites i and j, the mutual information I(i:j) measures the 
total amount of shared information between them. 
We interpret strong correlations as proximity and weak correlations as distance by defining an 
information-theoretic distance that decreases monotonically with mutual information. From 
the full matrix of pairwise distances, we reconstruct an emergent geometry using 
multidimensional scaling (MDS). 
This procedure produces an explicit embedding of the quantum degrees of freedom into a 
low-dimensional metric space. The quality of the reconstruction can be quantified by the 
embedding error as a function of the target dimension. The effective spatial dimension is 
identified as the smallest dimension for which the reconstruction error becomes small and 
stable. 
In this picture, space is not fundamental. It is a geometric representation of the entanglement 
structure of the quantum state. 
5. Emergent Dimension 
A central result of this work is that spatial dimension itself is emergent. By controlling the 
structure of entanglement through a parameter λ, we interpolate between states dominated by 
local correlations and states with strong non-local entanglement. 
For local entanglement, the reconstructed geometry is well described by a two-dimensional 
embedding. When non-local correlations are introduced, the two-dimensional embedding 
becomes insufficient, and a higher-dimensional embedding is required to faithfully represent 
the information-theoretic distances. 
This demonstrates that spatial dimension is not an input of the theory but an output imposed 
by the pattern of quantum correlations. In finite systems, the transition is gradual, but the 
hierarchy of embedding errors provides a clear operational signal of dimensional emergence. 
6. ER = EPR as Geodesic Shortening 
The correspondence ER = EPR suggests a deep relationship between quantum entanglement 
and spacetime geometry. In our framework, this idea can be tested operationally. 
We consider pairs of qubits that are topologically distant on the interaction graph but strongly 
entangled. While their topological distance remains fixed, their distance in the reconstructed 
emergent geometry decreases sharply as non-local entanglement is increased. 
This geodesic shortening provides a finite-size, geometric signature of ER = EPR. It does not 
represent a dynamical wormhole in the sense of general relativity, but rather a wormhole-like 
shortcut in the emergent geometry reconstructed from entanglement. 
7. Gravity as Entanglement Thermodynamics 
Jacobson famously showed that Einstein’s equations can be interpreted as an equation of 
state, relating variations of entropy and energy. Inspired by this idea, we test a thermodynamic 
relation of the form δS ≈ β δE in our finite quantum systems. 
We compute the entanglement entropy of a chosen region and the expectation value of an 
effective Hamiltonian as functions of the entanglement control parameter λ. A stable linear 
relation between entropy variations and energy variations is observed. 
The proportionality factor β can be interpreted as an effective inverse temperature. This result 
supports the interpretation of gravity not as a fundamental force, but as an emergent, 
thermodynamic response of entanglement. 
8. Finite-Size Scaling: From N = 9 to N = 16 
The initial proof of concept is established on a minimal system of N = 9 qubits, which allows 
for exact numerical treatment but suffers from strong boundary effects. To test robustness, we 
extend the analysis to a larger system of N = 16 qubits arranged on a 4×4 grid. 
The extension confirms all three central signatures. The dimensional transition becomes 
sharper, the ER = EPR geodesic shortening becomes more stable, and the thermodynamic 
relation shows reduced fluctuations. These improvements indicate that the results are not 
artifacts of minimal system size. 
While N = 16 is still far from the thermodynamic limit, it provides a crucial validation step 
and motivates further exploration at larger scales using approximate many-body methods. 
9. Conclusion 
We have presented a bottom-up framework in which space, time, dimension, and gravity 
emerge from the entanglement structure of a global quantum state. Using explicit numerical 
constructions on finite systems, we have demonstrated three robust signatures: emergent 
dimensionality, ER = EPR–like geometric shortcuts, and a thermodynamic relation 
reminiscent of gravity. 
The extension from N = 9 to N = 16 qubits confirms the robustness of these mechanisms and 
reduces finite-size effects. These results suggest that spacetime geometry may be understood 
as an effective, collective description of quantum entanglement. 
The framework opens several directions for future work, including extensions to larger 
systems, the use of tensor-network methods, and the study of dynamical or time-dependent 
entanglement structures. Ultimately, this approach points toward a view of fundamental 
physics in which spacetime itself is an emergent phenomenon.
